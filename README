To merge the code from the dev branch to the main branch in Git, you can use the following steps:

Make sure you are on the main branch by running the command:
    git checkout main
Pull the latest changes from the remote repository:
    git pull origin main
Merge the dev branch into the main branch:
    git merge dev
Resolve any merge conflicts that may arise. Git will automatically attempt to merge the changes, but if there are conflicts, you will need to manually resolve them.

Once the conflicts are resolved, commit the changes:
    git commit -m "Merge dev branch into main"
Finally, push the changes to the remote repository:
    git push origin main
These steps will merge the code from the dev branch into the main branch in Git.




TO INITIATE THE DATABASE RUN THE COMMAND BELOW
Step 0: `$ set FLASK_APP=yourapp`
Step 1: `$ flask db init` or `python -m flask db init`
Step 2: `$ flask db migrate` or `python -m flask db migrate`
Step 3: `$ flask db upgrade` or `python -m flask db upgrade`


ERRORS FOUND

If you get issues like described bellow, when you are trying to migrade or update the database,
`ERROR [flask_migrate] Error: Target database is not up to date.`
one possible way to solve it is using the `stamp` command: 
`$ python -m flask db stamp`
and then use `migrate`
