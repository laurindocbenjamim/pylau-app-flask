    <h1>Introduction to Python</h1>
    <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability and simplicity, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced developers alike.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <p>Some of the key features of Python include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Easy to read and write: Python's syntax is clear and concise, making it easy to learn and use.</li>
        <li>Interpreted language: Python code is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier.</li>
        <li>Dynamic typing: Python automatically determines the type of a variable at runtime, which simplifies code writing.</li>
        <li>Extensive standard library: Python comes with a vast standard library that includes modules for various tasks such as file I/O, web development, and data manipulation.</li>
        <li>Community support: Python has a large and active community that contributes to its development and provides support through forums, tutorials, and documentation.</li>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>To get started with Python, you need to install it on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: <a href="https://www.python.org/">python.org</a>.</p>
    <p>Once you have Python installed, you can write your first Python program. Open a text editor and type the following code:</p>
    <pre><code>print("Hello, World!")</code></pre>
    <p>Save the file with a <code>.py</code> extension, for example, <code>hello.py</code>. Then, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Run the program by typing:</p>
    <pre><code>python hello.py</code></pre>
    <p>You should see the output:</p>
    <pre><code>Hello, World!</code></pre>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Python is a versatile and powerful programming language that is widely used in various fields such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing.
